# Hydration Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the hydration issues that were identified and fixed in the Next.js application to resolve SSR/client mismatch errors.

## Issues Identified

1. **Time-based content rendering different values on server vs client**
   - Countdown timers in Header and PromoBar components
   - Date.now() calls during component initialization
   - Dynamic time calculations causing mismatches

2. **Client-side state not properly handled during SSR**
   - Mobile detection hooks running during server render
   - Components rendering different content based on client state

3. **Missing hydration safety measures**
   - Components using browser-only APIs without proper guards
   - State initialization differences between server and client

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Header Component (`components/header.tsx`)
- Added `useMounted` hook to prevent countdown timer from running during SSR
- Ensured countdown only renders after client-side mounting
- Provided consistent fallback content for server-side rendering

### 2. PromoBar Component (`components/promo-bar.tsx`)
- Added `useMounted` hook for hydration safety
- Moved Date.now() calls to useEffect to avoid SSR execution
- Provided fallback countdown display during server render
- Ensured dynamic content only updates after client mounting

### 3. Mobile Detection Hooks (`hooks/use-mobile.tsx`, `components/ui/use-mobile.tsx`)
- Added `useMounted` hook to prevent window access during SSR
- Return `undefined` during server render to prevent hydration mismatch
- Only access browser APIs after client-side mounting

### 4. Sidebar Component (`components/ui/sidebar.tsx`)
- Updated to use new `useMobile` hook
- Added proper handling for undefined mobile state during SSR
- Ensured context values are consistent between server and client

### 5. Layout Component (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` as temporary measure
- This prevents immediate hydration errors while components are being fixed

### 6. Utility Hooks
- Created `useMounted` hook for consistent hydration safety across components
- Ensures components can safely check if they're running on client side

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Always use mounted state for client-only features**
   ```tsx
   const mounted = useMounted()
   
   if (!mounted) {
     return <FallbackContent />
   }
   
   return <ClientOnlyContent />
   ```

2. **Avoid Date.now() and Math.random() during initial render**
   - Move to useEffect or useMemo with proper dependencies
   - Provide consistent fallback values for SSR

3. **Handle undefined states gracefully**
   - Check for mounted state before accessing browser APIs
   - Provide fallback values during server render

4. **Use suppressHydrationWarning sparingly**
   - Only as temporary measure while fixing components
   - Remove once all hydration issues are resolved

## Testing

To verify fixes are working:
1. Check browser console for hydration warnings
2. Ensure countdown timers display consistently
3. Verify mobile detection works without errors
4. Confirm no SSR/client content mismatches

## Next Steps

1. Remove `suppressHydrationWarning` from layout once all issues are confirmed fixed
2. Test on different devices and screen sizes
3. Monitor for any new hydration issues during development
4. Consider implementing more robust error boundaries for client-only features
